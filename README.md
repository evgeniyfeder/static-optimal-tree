# Code with experiments on static-optimal tree networks

Currentrly here we have:
* building a static-optimal network using dp O(n^3) time
* building static-optimal network for the uniform requests in O(n) time
* SAN algorithms: SplayNet, CentralSplayNet, LazyOptNet
* helpful staff for viewing tree graphs (st_random.sh and drawgraph.py)

Instruction for generating charts in ``scripts`` folder.
